This folder contains three sub-folders, each housing models related to their respective tasks. Here is the folder structure for the `models/` directory:

```
└───models/
        ├───explicit_image_classifier/
        ├───face_extraction/
        └───fake_image_classifier/
```
* The models themselves are not committed into the repository.
* These models are ignored by .gitignore, meaning they will not be tracked by Git.
* As a result, the sub-folders will appear empty in the repository, since the models are excluded from version control.
